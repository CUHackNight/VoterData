# CU-Hack Night Voting History Warehouse
This project implements a dimensional data warehouse for voting behavior for
Champaign county voters. It creates a warehouse of voting information that
reports every voter who participated in an election and keeps track
of how old they are, gender, where they are registered and where (and when)
they voted.
